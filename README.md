# Typing Test Project

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-100%25-green)](https://travis-ci.com/username/projectname)

This is my first web-development project using vanilla js and HTML:5. It's nothing fancy.

### RoadMap

1. Add different modes of typing.
2. Add the ability the add **custom _text/words_ by the user**.
3. **_Style_** changes.[done]
